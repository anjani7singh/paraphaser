Lexical ambiguity occurs when a word has more than one possible meanings.,154701,"When a word has multiple meanings, it is said to be ambiguous."
Structural ambiguity is a situation where one sentence has more than one meaning due to its sentence structure.,154702,The term structural ambiguity refers to the situation in which a sentence can be understood differently by different readers due to its syntax.

"Phonology is defined as the study of sound patterns and their meanings, both within and across languages.",154707,Phonology is the study of sound patterns and their meanings within and between languages.

"Therefore, they feel that phonetics provides a scientific theory of sound structure while phonology is a relatively uninteresting subfield of the humanities.",154710,"Thus, a phonetician is a scientist who studies sound structure, whereas a phonologist is a humanist who studies sound structure purely for entertainment purposes."
"Lexical relations such as homonymy, polysemy, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, and meronymy are well-established semantic links between words in the mental lexicon, but in modern linguistic approaches to lexical semantics, the focus is more often on aspects of meaning below the word level.",154711,"Linguistic approaches to lexical semantics frequently focus on meaning aspects below the word level rather than lexical relations such as homonymy, polysemy, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, and meronymy."
Lexical relations are one of the most important semantic relations in exploring the meanings of words in English language.,154712,"When it comes to determining the meaning of words in English, lexical relations are one of the most important semantic relations."
They are mainly used to analysis the meanings of words in terms of their relations to each other within sentences.,154713,They are primarily used in sentences to analyze word meanings based on their relationships to one another.
There are two types of semantics: lexical and compositional.,154714,It is possible to make a semantic distinction between lexical and compositional considerations.
